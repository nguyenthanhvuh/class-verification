## Description

This special topics course is a research seminar in **software verification and analysis**. 
The course covers active research areas in program analyses, but the specific topics will be largely determined by a combination of instructor fiat and the interests of the students. 
We will also focus on the **applications** of these techniques, i.e., their uses in emergining computing domains such as Machine Learning, IoT, and Robotics.

## Grading

You will be evaluated based on discussion and writting summaries on
reading assignments and completing a final project.

### Reading ([Schedule and Assignments](assignments.md))

We will read papers covering various topics including model checking,
symbolic and concolic executions, constraint solving (e.g., SMT
solvers), interactive theorem proving, automatic debugging, invariant
generation (dynamic vs static analyses), automatic program repair,
program synthesis (e.g., syntax-guided synthesis). We will also read
papers that apply these techniques in practice (e.g., testing and
verifying a Deep Neural Network or infering properties of an IoT
system).

On average, we will discuss ****three papers**** a week (~50 minutes to
each paper). You are responsible for reading at least **two papers**
in advance for any given discussion.

At the beginning of each paper discussion I will choose up to **three
students** at random. Each student will give a **five-minute**
presentation about the paper. This presentation must includes:

1.  the problem (what is it? why is it interesting?)
2.  existing approaches (what are they? what are their limitations?)
3.  the proposed technical approach (also talk about the strengths of approach and how the approach addresses the weaknesses of existing works)
4.  limitations of the proposed approach and lists ways in which it
    might be improved.

You can also include other information, such as your opinion about the
work, or its relation to other work you may know. The goals of this
approach are to encourage all participants to read the material
thoroughly in advance, to provide jumping-off points for detailed
discussions, and to allow me to evaluate participation.

In addition, these students will help engage discussions about the
paper.

### Project ([Project Info](project.org))

1.  Proposal

    By the end of the 3th week, submit a project proposal (1-2 page)
    that explains what you want to do and what you expect to learn from
    the project (i.e., why is it interesting to you?).

    In addition, include:

    1.  A survey of the work in selected topic (e.g., read 3 papers
        thoroughly and 3 other papers superficially).
    2.  A work schedule. Make sure to budget time for writing a short
        project paper describing the project described below.

2.  Report

    Submit a project report (5-7 pages) during dead week (**11:59 PM
    Sunday**).

    You will write the report as if you were submitting to a conference
    such as PLDI or FSE (e.g., using LaTeX templates for these
    conferences and including all the usual sections such as
    Introduction, Body, Related Work, Conclusion). Turn in the complete
    PDF as well as your LaTeX source.

## Course Policy

-   It is CSE Department policy that all students in CSE courses are
    expected to regularly check their email so they do not miss
    important announcements.

-   All homework assignments, quizzes, exams, etc. must be your own
    work. No direct collaboration with fellow students, past or current,
    is allowed unless otherwise stated. The Computer Science &
    Engineering department has an [Academic Integrity
    Policy](https://cse.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy). All students
    enrolled in any computer science course are bound by this policy.
    You are expected to read, understand, and follow this policy.
    Violations will be dealt with on a case by case basis and may result
    in a failing assignment or a failing grade for the course itself.

-   The CSE Department has an [anonymous contact
    form](https://cse.unl.edu/contact-form) that you may use to voice
    your concerns about any problems in the course or department if you
    do not wish to be identified.

-   Consider the [Student Resource Center](http://cse.unl.edu/src) in
    Avery 12 for additional help (e.g., TA\'s, tutorings, etc)

-   Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor
    for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic
    accommodation. It is the policy of the University of
    Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized
    accommodations to students with documented disabilities that may
    affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to
    meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services,
    students must be registered with the Services for Students with
    Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787
    voice or TTY.
