# Announcements:

## First Class Meeting

# Overview

This special topics course is a research seminar on **AI Verification**.
The course will focus on active research areas in formal AI verification
and analysis, but the specific topics will be largely determined by a
combination of instructor fiat and the interests of the students.

# Requirements and Grading

You will be evaluated based on reading & discussion and completing a
final project.

## Reading

We will read papers covering various topics including the applications
of verification, testing, analysis, constraint solving, and abstraction
techniques to Deep Neural Networks such as Feedforward Neural Networks
(FNNs), Residual Networks (ResNet), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

On average, we will discuss **two papers** a week (~50 minutes to each
paper) from the list below. You are responsible for reading the
**assigned papers** in advance for any given discussion.

Each student will be assigned to **lead a paper**.

-   You will guide the discussion
-   You will write a full concrete example illustrating the proposed
    techinque (details below). This example will be due **2 weeks**
    after the paper is completed.
-   **Tools**: Usually each research paper has a free implementation
    tool. I will take into account when evaluating if you try out the
    tool and discuss some interesting things that it can or cannot do
    (e.g., try the the tool on some small but nontrivial examples). This
    will help you understand the readings better and give you ideas on
    how to use existing tools in your own work.

At the beginning of **each paper** discussion I will choose up to
**three students** who is *not* the paper lead at random.

-   Each student will give a **five-minute** presentation that at least
    -   summarizes the work,
    -   lists its strengths, and
    -   lists ways in which it might be improved.
    -   You can also include other information, such as your opinion
        about the work, or its relation to other work you may know.
    -   The goals of this approach are to encourage all participants to
        read the material thoroughly in advance, to provide jumping-off
        points for detailed discussions, and to allow me to evaluate
        participation.

### [Reading List](./reading.html)

## Project

For each paper that you lead, you will provide a simple implementation
of the technique you read.

You are expected to select and complete a research project that explores
more deeply a topic covered in the course (or a related topic which we
didn't cover). Examples including developing a new or improved
technique to solve an existing problem, or applying an existing
technique/tool to a new problem. This kind of research project typically
involves some survey work, some implementation, and some evaluation.

Several things to keep in mind:

-   I do not expect very fancy project. The goal of the project is to
    allow you to customize the content of the course to your own
    interests. The goal is not to force you to produce novel results in
    one semester.
-   25-30 hours should suffice (so if you actually put in about 2 hours
    a week, you would have a good project).
-   But don't attempt to do everything in the last week, it will not
    work!
-   You are welcome to tackle a more ambitious project. Such a project
    should have "stages" so that you have something to show at the end
    of the semester. I (or your advisor) can provide extra guidance on
    such projects.
-   If you have a great idea and need help, feel free to work as a pair.
    However, given the scope of most projects, I think they are better
    done alone. Notably, the grading for a two-person project will
    actually require "twice as much work" rather than the standard
    "1.5-times as much work".
-   I encourage you to define your own project. In case you do not have
    any ideas or want to try something new, I can give you some project
    ideas.

You will need to submit a project proposal and a project report.

1.  **Proposal**: by the end of the 4th week, submit a project proposal
    (1-2 page) that explains what you want to do and what you expect to
    learn from the project (i.e., why is it interesting to you?).
    Here's an [example](./pre_proposal.pdf) (in particular focus on the
    **Task Proprosal** section).

In addition, include:

-   A **survey of the work** in selected topic (e.g., read 3 papers
    thoroughly and 3 other papers superficially).

-   A **work schedule**. Make sure to budget time for writing a short
    project paper describing the project described below.

-   **Report**: by the last week of the semester, submit a project
    report (5-7 pages).

    -   You will write the report as if you were submitting to a
        conference such as PLDI or ICSE (e.g., using LaTeX templates for
        these conferences and including all the usual sections such as
        Introduction, Body, Related Work, Conclusion).
    -   Turn in the complete PDF as well as your LaTeX source.

**Presentation**: You can choose whether to give a 10-min presentation
of your project in the final week. If you give a project presentation, I
take that into account when evaluating and grading your final project
(e.g., delivering a good presentation counts as some amount of work
done, so I expect a bit less from the writeup). By contrast, if you turn
in only the final project writeup, you should ensure that it contains
enough information for me to assess your work done.
