## Description

This special topics course is a research seminar on ****AI Verification
and Analysis****. The course will focus on active research areas in
formal AI reasoning, but the specific topics will be largely determined
by a combination of instructor fiat and the interests of the students.

## Prerequiste

-   No prerequiste courses (but knowledge in linear algebra is strongly
    recommended)
-   Programming knowledge (preferrably Python): capable of developing a
    project of roughly about 1000 lines of code

## Grading

You will be evaluated based on

1.  weekly reading assignments and discussions,
2.  a programming project

### Reading and Discussion ([Reading Assignments](https://github.com/nguyenthanhvuh/class-verification/wiki/reading))

We will read papers covering various topics including the applications
of verification, testing, analysis, constraint solving, and abstraction
techniques to Deep Neural Networks such as Feedforward Neural Networks
(FNNs), Residual Networks (ResNet), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

On average, we will discuss ****two papers**** a week (\~50 minutes to
each paper). You are responsible for reading the sasigned papers in
advance for any given discussion.

Each student will be assigned to ****lead a paper**** that talks about a
technique

-   You will present ****in depth**** the paper you read
    -   You will need to do a Powerpoint presentation style
    -   This include providing concrete examples illustrating how the
        technique
-   You will guide the discussion
-   ****Tools****: Usually each research paper has a free implementation
    tool. I will take into account when evaluating if you try out the
    tool and discuss some interesting things that it can or cannot do
    (e.g., try the the tool on some small but nontrivial examples). This
    will help you understand the readings better and give you ideas on
    how to use existing tools in your own work.

At the beginning of ****each paper**** discussion I will choose at
random up to ****three students**** who is **not** the paper.

-   Each student will give a ****five-minute**** presentation that at
    least
    1.  the problem (what is it? why is it interesting?)
    2.  existing approaches (what are they? what are their limitations?)
    3.  the proposed technical approach (also talk about the strengths
        of approach and how the approach addresses the weaknesses of
        existing works)
    4.  limitations of the proposed approach and lists ways in which it
        might be improved.
-   The goals of this approach are to encourage all participants to read
    the material thoroughly in advance, to provide jumping-off points
    for detailed discussions, and to allow me to evaluate participation.

### Project

Each student will understand in depth (or own) a DNN analysis technique.
This technique is from one of the papers you lead. Your project consists
of 2 parts

#### Example Illustration

-   You will write a \"blog\" describing full concrete example
    illustrating the DNN technique assigned to you. This example will be
    due ****2 weeks**** after the paper is read.

-   Format

    -   Written in **Markdown**
    -   Posted on the class\'s wiki
    -   Consist of a full illustration on how the technique works on a
        given example (e.g., how Reluplex works on a simple DNN).

#### Programming Project ([Project Info](project.org))

-   You will implement the DNN analysis technique using Python.
    -   You will be given some example code in Python.
    -   If you prefer a different language, talk to me first.
-   In your \"blog\" entry above, you will write how you apply your
    implementation to the example illustration you had.

## Honor Code

As with all GMU courses, this class governed by the [GMU Honor
Code](http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code/). In this course, all
assignments carry with them an implicit statement that it is the sole
work of the author.

## Learning Disabilities

Students with learning disabilities (or other conditions documented with
GMU Office of Disability Services) who need academic accommodations
should see me and contact the [Disability Resource
Center](http://ods.gmu.edu/) (DRC) at (703)993-2474. I am more than
happy to assist you, but all academic accommodations must be arranged
through the DRC.
