    Office Hours: After class

## Description

This special topics course is a research seminar in **software verification and analysis**. 
The course covers active research areas in program analyses, but the specific topics will be largely determined by a combination of instructor fiat and the interests of the students. 
We will also focus on the **applications** of these techniques, i.e., their uses in emergining computing domains such as Machine Learning, IoT, and Robotics.

## Grading

You will be evaluated based on discussion and writting summaries on
reading assignments and completing a final project.

### Reading ([Reading List](assignments.md))

We will read papers covering various topics including model checking,
symbolic and concolic executions, constraint solving (e.g., SMT
solvers), interactive theorem proving, automatic debugging, invariant
generation (dynamic vs static analyses), automatic program repair,
program synthesis (e.g., syntax-guided synthesis). We will also read
papers that apply these techniques in practice (e.g., testing and
verifying a Deep Neural Network or infering properties of an IoT
system).


### Project ([Project Info](project.md))

All students are expected to select and complete a project that explores
more deeply a topic covered in the course (or a related topic which we
didn't cover).

The main goal of the project is for you to learn and understand topic in
depth. The goal is not to force you all to produce novel results in one
semester. Course projects like this often lead to collaborations that
eventually yield exciting research. In the hopefully-likely event that
you end up enjoying your project, come see me about taking it further
(say, to publication).

## Course Policy

-   It is CSE Department policy that all students in CSE courses are
    expected to regularly check their email so they do not miss
    important announcements.

-   All homework assignments, quizzes, exams, etc. must be your own
    work. No direct collaboration with fellow students, past or current,
    is allowed unless otherwise stated. The Computer Science &
    Engineering department has an [Academic Integrity
    Policy](https://cse.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy). All students
    enrolled in any computer science course are bound by this policy.
    You are expected to read, understand, and follow this policy.
    Violations will be dealt with on a case by case basis and may result
    in a failing assignment or a failing grade for the course itself.

-   The CSE Department has an [anonymous contact
    form](https://cse.unl.edu/contact-form) that you may use to voice
    your concerns about any problems in the course or department if you
    do not wish to be identified.

-   Consider the [Student Resource Center](http://cse.unl.edu/src) in
    Avery 12 for additional help (e.g., TA\'s, tutorings, etc)

-   Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor
    for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic
    accommodation. It is the policy of the University of
    Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized
    accommodations to students with documented disabilities that may
    affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to
    meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services,
    students must be registered with the Services for Students with
    Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787
    voice or TTY.
